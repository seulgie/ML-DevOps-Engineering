# ML-DevOps-Engineering

## Overview
The Machine Learning DevOps Engineer Nanodegree program focuses on the software engineering needed to successfully streamline
the deployment of data and machine-learning models in a production-level environment.

## Objectives
* Implement production-ready python code & processes for deploying ML models in production
* Engineer automated data workflows that perform CI/CD pipeline based on updated data versioning
* Create multi-step pipelines that automatically retrain and deploy models after data updates
* Track model summary statistics and monitor model online performance over time to prevent model-degradation
